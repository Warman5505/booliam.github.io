    <h2>How To Solve Literal Equations</h2>
    	<ul>
     	 	<li>Step 1: Find an equation to solve, for this equation we'll use E = mc², let's say that you want to find c.</li>
     	 	<li>Step 2: Firstly, divide out m on both sides.</li> <!--Insert image of this process-->
      		<li>Step 3: Then, to remove the ², find the square root of both sides.</li> <!--insert another image of this-->
      		<li>Step 4: Finally, you've got:</li>  <!--insert one more image of the final product-->
